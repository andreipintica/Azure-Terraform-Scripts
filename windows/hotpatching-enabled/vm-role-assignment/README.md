This example is used to demonstrate how to perform a role assigned to a Virtual Machine (with System Assigned identity) to grant it permissions to access another Azure resource.

This example provisions:

Windows Virtual Machine with System Assigned identity
An Azure Storage Account
Performs a Role Assignment granting Reader role to the Windows Virtual Machine to access the storage account.
Similar pattern can be used:

to grant any other Azure built-in role (e.g. Contributor, Owner), or a custom user defined role.
to grant access to Azure resources other than a storage account (e.g. Resource Group, Service Bus, Event Hubs)
with Virtual Machines with User Assigned identity
with Linux Virtual Machines

## Variables

- ```admin``` - (Required) Virtual Machine Admin username
- ```adminPassword``` - (Required) Virtual Machine Admin Password
- ```location``` - (Required) Azure Region in which all resources in this example should be provisioned
- ```storageaccount``` - (Required) Name of the storage account to be provisioned
